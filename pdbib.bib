Although the 2 most frequently applied Parkinson's disease (PD) “quality of life” questionnaires (the PDQ-39 and PDQ-8) provide encouragingly similar results, their MCID thresholds appear to be vastly different. Our aim was to calculate the MCID estimates for both PDQ-39 and PDQ-8 Summary Indices (PDQ-39-SI and PDQ-8-SI) by the utilization of both anchor- and distribution-based techniques. Methods: Nine hundred eighty-five paired investigations of 365 patients were included. Three different techniques were used simultaneously to calculate the MCID values. Results: First, we replicated the previously published results demonstrating how both PDQ-39-SI and PDQ-8-SI provide similar values and respond in a similar way to changes. Subsequently, we calculated the MCID thresholds. The most optimal estimates for MCID thresholds for PDQ-39-SI were -4.72 and +4.22 for detecting minimal clinically important improvement and worsening. For PDQ-8-SI, these estimates were -5.94 and +4.91 points for detecting minimal clinically important improvement and worsening respectively. Conclusions: Our study is the first one that directly compared the MCID estimates for both PDQ-39-SI and PDQ-8-SI on a large pool of patients including all disease severity stages. These MICD estimates varied across PD severity.}",

Their mean age was 67.5 years, and 61\\% were men. All participants completed the TUG and the DGI assessments twice, about 14 days apart. The MDC was calculated from the standard error of measurement. The percentage MDC (MDC\\%) was calculated as the MDC divided by the mean of all scores for the sample. Furthermore, the intraclass correlation coefficient was used to examine the reproducibility between testing sessions (test-retest reliability).The respective MDC and MDC\\% of the TUG were 3.5 seconds and 29.8, and those of the DGI were 2.9 points and 13.3. The test-retest reliability values for the TUG and the DGI were high; the intraclass correlation coefficients were .80 and .84, respectively.The study sample was a convenience sample, and the participants had mild to moderately severe PD.The results showed that the TUG and the DGI have generally acceptable random measurement error and test-retest reliability. These findings should help clinicians and researchers determine whether a change in an individual patient with PD is a true change.}",

This study investigated the retest reliability, interrater reliability, and sensitivity of TUG scores in detecting changes in mobility in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD). Subjects. The performance of 12 people with PD was compared with that of 12 age-matched comparison subjects without PD. Methods. The subjects with PD completed 5 trials of the TUG after withdrawal of levodopa for 12 hours (“off” phase of the medication cycle) as well as an additional 5 trials 1 hour after levodopa was administered (“on” phase of the medication cycle). They were scored on the Modified Webster Scale at both sessions. The comparison subjects also performed 5 TUG trials. All trials were videotaped and timed by 2 experienced raters. The videotape was later rated by 3 experienced clinicians and 3 inexperienced clinicians. Results. For the subjects with PD, within-session performance was highly consistent, with correlations (r) ranging from .80 to .98 for the “off” phase and from .73 to .99 for the “on” phase. The performance of the comparison subjects across the 5 trials was also highly consistent (r=.90–.97). Comparisons showed differences between trials 1 and 2 on the TUG for both groups. Removal of data for trial 1 (the practice trial) further enhanced retest reliability. There was close agreement in TUG scores among raters despite different levels of experience (intraclass correlation coefficient [3,1]=.87–.99). Mean TUG scores were different between the “on” and “off” phases of the levodopa cycle and between subjects with PD and comparison subjects during the “on” phase. Conclusion and Discussion. Retest reliability and interrater reliability of the TUG measurements were high, and the measurements reflected changes in performance according to levodopa use. The TUG can also be used to detect differences in performance between people with PD and elderly people without PD.}",

The purpose of this study was to determine test-retest reliability and minimal detectable change for the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), forward and backward functional reach, the Romberg Test and the Sharpened Romberg Test (SRT) with eyes open and closed, the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), comfortable and fast gait speed, the Timed “Up \\&amp; Go” Test (TUG), the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) in people with parkinsonism.Thirty-seven community-dwelling adults with parkinsonism (mean age=71 years) participated. The Hoehn and Yahr Scale median score of 2 was on the lower end of the scale; however, the scores ranged from 1 to 4.Subjects were tested twice by the same raters, with 1 week between tests. Test-retest reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Minimal detectable change was calculated using a 95\\% confidence interval (MDC95).The ICCs for test-retest reliability were above .90 for the BBS, ABC Scale, SRT with eyes closed, 6MWT, and comfortable and fast gait speeds. The MDC95 values for those functional tests were: BBS=5/56, ABC Scale=13\\%, SRT with eyes closed=19 seconds, 6MWT=82 m, comfortable gait speed=0.18 m/s, and fast gait speed=0.25 m/s. The ICCs for test-retest reliability of SF-36 scores were above .80, with the exception of the social functioning subscale. The MDC95 values for the SF-36 ranged between 19\\% and 45\\%. The MDC95 values for the UPDRS Activities of Daily Living section, Motor Examination section, and total scores were 4/52, 11/108, and 13/176, respectively.Minimal detectable change values are useful to therapists in rehabilitation and wellness programs in determining whether change during or after intervention is clinically significant. High test-retest reliability of scores for the BBS, ABC Scale, SRT with eyes closed, 6MWT, and gait speed make them trustworthy functional assessments in people with parkinsonism. The SF-36 and UPDRS provide quality-of-life and disease severity rating values in the ongoing assessment of people with parkinsonism.}",
